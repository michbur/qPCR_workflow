  Abstract                 = {We revisit the problem of interval estimation of a binomial proportion. The erratic behavior of the coverage probability of the standard Wald confidence interval has previously been remarked on in the literature (Blyth and Still, Agresti and Coull, Santner and others). We begin by showing that the chaotic coverage properties of the Wald interval are far more persistent than is appreciated. Furthermore, common textbook prescriptions regarding its safety are misleading and defective in several respects and cannot be trusted. This leads us to consideration of alternative intervals. A number of natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and context. Each interval is examined for its coverage probability and its length. Based on this analysis, we recommend the Wilson interval or the equal-tailed Jeffreys prior interval for small n and the interval suggested in Agresti and Coull for larger n. We also provide an additional frequentist justification for use of the Jeffreys interval.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Currently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}) experiments. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader{\rq}s ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments. Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time {PCR} Experiments ({MIQE}) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. {MIQE} is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating {qPCR} experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. {MIQE} details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement. Summary: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of {qPCR} results.},

  Abstract                 = {The value assignment for properties of six certified reference materials (ERM-AD623a--f), each containing a plasmid DNA solution ranging from 1 million to 10 copies per μL, by using digital PCR (dPCR) with the BioMark\texttrademark HD System (Fluidigm) has been verified by applying droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) using the QX100 system (Bio-Rad). One of the critical factors in the measurement of copy number concentrations by digital PCR is the partition volume. Therefore, we determined the average droplet volume by optical microscopy, revealing an average droplet volume that is 8 \% smaller than the droplet volume used as the defined parameter in the QuantaSoft software version 1.3.2.0 (Bio-Rad) to calculate the copy number concentration. This observation explains why copy number concentrations estimated with ddPCR and using an average droplet volume predefined in the QuantaSoft software were systematically lower than those measured by dPCR, creating a significant bias between the values obtained by these two techniques. The difference was not significant anymore when the measured droplet volume of 0.834 nL was used to estimate copy number concentrations. A new version of QuantaSoft software (version 1.6.6.0320), which has since been released with Bio-Rad’s new QX200 systems and QX100 upgrades, uses a droplet volume of 0.85 nL as a defined parameter to calculate copy number concentration.,

  Abstract                 = {Recent years have seen the emergence of new high-throughput {PCR} and sequencing platforms with the potential to bring analysis of transcriptional biomarkers to a broader range of clinical applications and to provide increasing depth to our understanding of the transcriptome. We present an overview of how to process clinical samples for {RNA} biomarker analysis in terms of {RNA} extraction and {mRNA} enrichment, and guidelines for sample analysis by {RT}-{qPCR} and digital {PCR} using nanofluidic real-time {PCR} platforms. The options for quantitative gene expression profiling and whole transcriptome sequencing by next generation sequencing are reviewed alongside the bioinformatic considerations for these approaches. Considering the diverse technologies now available for transcriptome analysis, methods for standardising measurements between platforms will be paramount if their diagnostic impact is to be maximised. Therefore, the use of {RNA} standards and other reference materials is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time {PCR} analysis is a sensitive {DNA} 
quantification 
technique that has recently gained considerable attention in biotechnology, 
microbiology and molecular diagnostics. Although, the cycle-threshold (Ct) 
method is the present "gold standard", it is far from being a standard assay. 
Uniform reaction efficiency among samples is the most important assumption of 
this method. Nevertheless, some authors have reported that it may not be 
correct 
and a slight {PCR} efficiency decrease of about 4\% could result in an error of 
up to 400\% using the Ct method. This reaction efficiency decrease may be 
caused 
by inhibiting agents used during nucleic acid extraction or copurified from the 
biological sample.

  Abstract                 = {Background: Digital PCR (dPCR) is an increasingly popular manifestation of PCR that offers a number of unique advantages when applied to preclinical research, particularly when used to detect rare mutations and in the precise quantification of nucleic acids. As is common with many new research methods, the application of dPCR to potential clinical scenarios is also being increasingly described.
 Content: This review addresses some of the factors that need to be considered in the application of dPCR. Compared to real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), dPCR clearly has the potential to offer more sensitive and considerably more reproducible clinical methods that could lend themselves to diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests. But for this to be realized the technology will need to be further developed to reduce cost and simplify application. Concomitantly the preclinical research will need be reported with a comprehensive understanding of the associated errors. dPCR benefits from a far more predictable variance than qPCR but is as susceptible to upstream errors associated with factors like sampling and extraction. dPCR can also suffer systematic bias, particularly leading to underestimation, and internal positive controls are likely to be as important for dPCR as they are for qPCR, especially when reporting the absence of a sequence.
 Summary: In this review we highlight some of the considerations that may be needed when applying dPCR and discuss sources of error. The factors discussed here aim to assist in the translation of dPCR to diagnostic, predictive, or prognostic applications.},

  Abstract                 = {There is growing interest in digital PCR (dPCR) because technological progress makes it a practical and increasingly affordable technology. dPCR allows the precise quantification of nucleic acids, facilitating the measurement of small percentage differences and quantification of rare variants. dPCR may also be more reproducible and less susceptible to inhibition than quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Consequently, dPCR has the potential to have a substantial impact on research as well as diagnostic applications. However, as with qPCR, the ability to perform robust meaningful experiments requires careful design and adequate controls. To assist independent evaluation of experimental data, comprehensive disclosure of all relevant experimental details is required. To facilitate this process we present the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital PCR Experiments guidelines. This report addresses known requirements for dPCR that have already been identified during this early stage of its development and commercial implementation. Adoption of these guidelines by the scientific community will help to standardize experimental protocols, maximize efficient utilization of resources, and enhance the impact of this promising new technology.},

Besides varying micro-environmental conditions, cell inherent features like cell cycle dependent localization and concentration of regulatory proteins as well as epigenetic properties are well accepted mechanisms creating cell heterogeneity. Another suspected reason is molecular noise on the transcriptional and translational level. A promising tool to unravel reasons for cell heterogeneity is the combination of cell sorting and subpopulation proteomics. This review summarizes recent developments in prokaryotic single-cell analytics and provides a workflow for selection of single cells, low cell number mass spectrometry, and proteomics evaluation. This approach is useful for understanding the dependency of individual cell decisions on inherent protein profiles.},

  Abstract                 = {Many biotechnological processes rely on the expression of a plasmid-based target gene. A constant and sufficient number of plasmids per cell is desired for efficient protein production. To date, only a few methods for the determination of plasmid copy number (PCN) are available, and most of them average the PCN of total populations disregarding heterogeneous distributions. Here, we utilize the highly precise quantification of DNA molecules by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and combine it with cell sorting using flow cytometry. A duplex PCR assay was set up requiring only 1000 sorted cells for precise determination of PCN. The robustness of this method was proven by thorough optimization of cell sorting, cell disruption, and PCR conditions. When non plasmid-harboring cells of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 were spiked with different dilutions of the expression plasmid pA-EGFP\_B, a PCN from 1 to 64 could be accurately detected. As a proof of principle, induced cultures of P. putida KT2440 producing an EGFP-fused model protein by means of the plasmid pA-EGFP\_B were investigated by flow cytometry and showed two distinct subpopulations, fluorescent and nonfluorescent cells. These two subpopulations were sorted for PCN determination with ddPCR. A remarkably diverging plasmid distribution was found within the population, with nonfluorescent cells showing a much lower PCN (≤1) than fluorescent cells (PCN of up to 5) under standard conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Early diagnosis of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is urgently needed to optimize treatment regimens and to prevent the transmission of resistant strains. Real-time PCR assays have been developed to detect drug resistance rapidly, but none of them have been widely applied due to their complexity, high cost, or requirement for advanced instruments. In this study, we developed a real-time PCR method based on melting curve analysis of dually labeled probes. Six probes targeting the rpoB 81-bp core region, katG315, the inhA promoter, the ahpC promoter, and embB306 were designed and validated with clinical isolates. First, 10 multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains with a wide mutation spectrum were used to analyze the melting temperature (Tm) deviations of different mutations by single real-time PCR. All mutations can be detected by significant Tm reductions compared to the wild type. Then, three duplex real-time PCRs, with two probes in each, were developed to detect mutations in 158 MDR isolates. Comparison of the results with the sequencing data showed that all mutations covered by the six probes were detected with 100\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Our method provided a new way to rapidly detect drug-resistant mutations in M. tuberculosis. Compared to other real-time PCR methods, we use fewer probes, which are labeled with the same fluorophore, guaranteeing that this assay can be used for detection in a single fluorescent channel or can be run on single-channel instruments. In conclusion, we have developed a widely applicable real-time PCR assay to detect drug-resistant mutations in M. tuberculosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The great promise of digital PCR is the potential for unparalleled precision enabling accurate measurements for genetic quantification. A challenge associated with digital PCR experiments, when testing unknown samples, is to perform experiments at dilutions allowing the detection of one or more targets of interest at a desired level of precision. While theory states that optimal precision (Po) is achieved by targeting {\textasciitilde}1.59 mean copies per partition (λ), and that dynamic range (R) includes the space spanning one positive (λL) to one negative (λU) result from the total number of partitions (n), these results are tempered for the practitioner seeking to construct digital PCR experiments in the laboratory. A mathematical framework is presented elucidating the relationships between precision, dynamic range, number of partitions, interrogated volume, and sensitivity in digital PCR. The impact that false reaction calls and volumetric variation have on sensitivity and precision is next considered. The resultant effects on sensitivity and precision are established via Monte Carlo simulations reflecting the real-world likelihood of encountering such scenarios in the laboratory. The simulations provide insight to the practitioner on how to adapt experimental loading concentrations to counteract any one of these conditions. The framework is augmented with a method of extending the dynamic range of digital PCR, with and without increasing n, via the use of dilutions. An example experiment demonstrating the capabilities of the framework is presented enabling detection across 3.33 logs of starting copy concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital {PCR} offers very high sensitivity compared to many other technologies for processing molecular detection assays. Herein, a process is outlined for determining the lower limit of detection ({LoD}) of two droplet-based digital {PCR} assays for point mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) gene. Hydrolysis probe mutation-detection assays for {EGFR} p.L858R and p.T790M mutations were characterized in detail. Furthermore, sixteen additional cancer-related mutation assays were explored by the same approach. For the {EGFR} L8585R assay, the assay sensitivity is extremely good, and thus, the {LoD} is limited by the amount of amplifiable {DNA} that is analyzed. With 95\% confidence limits, the {LoD} is one mutant in 180,000 wild-type molecules for the evaluation of 3.3 μg of genomic {DNA}, and detection of one mutant molecule in over 4 million wild-type molecules was achieved when 70 million copies of {DNA} were processed. The measured false-positive rate for the {EGFR} L8585R assay is one in 14 million, which indicates the theoretical {LoD} if an unlimited amount of {DNA} is evaluated. For the {EFGR} T790M assay, the {LoD} is one mutant in 13,000 for analysis of a 3.3 μg sample of genomic {DNA}, and the {dPCR} assay limit sensitivity approaches one mutant in 22,000 wild-type molecules.},

There are also a number of alternative nucleic acid amplification technologies, which unlike PCR, work at a single temperature. These ‘isothermal’ methods, reportedly offer potential advantages over PCR such as simplicity, speed and resistance to inhibitors and could also be used for quantitative molecular analysis. However there are currently limited mechanisms to evaluate their quantitative performance, which would assist assay development and study comparisons. This study uses a sexually transmitted infection diagnostic model in combination with an adapted metric termed isothermal doubling time (IDT), akin to PCR efficiency, to compare quantitative PCR and quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qLAMP) assays, and to quantify the impact of matrix interference. The performance metric described here facilitates the comparison of qLAMP assays that could assist assay development and validation activities.},

Analysis of qPCR data is a crucial part of the entire experiment, which has led to the development of a plethora of methods.

 Here, we surveyed 27 open-access software packages and tools for the analysis of qPCR data. The survey includes 8 Microsoft Windows, 5 web-based, 9 R-based and 5 tools from other platforms. Reviewed packages and tools support the analysis of different qPCR applications, such as RNA quantification, DNA methylation, genotyping, identification of copy number variations, and digital PCR. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual software tools, such as data exchange formats, availability of a graphical user interface, included procedures for graphical data presentation, and offered statistical methods. In addition, we provide an overview about quantification strategies, and report various applications of qPCR.
 
 Our comprehensive survey showed that most tools use their own file format and only a fraction of the currently existing tools support the standardized data exchange format RDML. To allow a more streamlined and comparable analysis of qPCR data, more vendors and tools need to adapt the standardized format to encourage the exchange of data between instrument software, analysis tools, and researchers.},

  Abstract                 = {Real‐time PCR is being used increasingly as the method of choice for mRNA quantification, allowing rapid analysis of gene expression from low quantities of starting template. Despite a wide range of approaches, the same principles underlie all data analysis, with standard approaches broadly classified as either absolute or relative. In this study we use a variety of absolute and relative approaches of data analysis to investigate nocturnal c‐fos expression in wild‐type and retinally degenerate mice. In addition, we apply a simple algorithm to calculate the amplification efficiency of every sample from its amplification profile. We confirm that nocturnal c‐fos expression in the rodent eye originates from the photoreceptor layer, with around a 5‐fold reduction in nocturnal c‐fos expression in mice lacking rods and cones. Furthermore, we illustrate that differences in the results obtained from absolute and relative approaches are underpinned by differences in the calculated PCR efficiency. By calculating the amplification efficiency from the samples under analysis, comparable results may be obtained without the need for standard curves. We have automated this method to provide a means of streamlining the real‐time PCR process, enabling analysis of experimental samples based upon their own reaction kinetics rather than those of artificial standards.},

  Abstract                 = {Microbead-based technologies represent elegant and versatile approaches for highly parallelized quantitative multiparameter assays. They also form the basis of various techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic acids and proteins. Nucleic acid-based methods include hybridization assays, solid-phase {PCR}, sequencing, and trapping assays. Microbead assays have been improved in the past decades and are now important tools in routine and point-of-care diagnostics as well as in life science. Its advances include low costs, low workload, high speed and high-throughput automation. The potential of microbead-based assays therefore is apparent, and commercial applications can be found in the detection and discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphism, of pathogens, and in trapping assays. This review provides an overview on microbead-based platforms for biosensing with a main focus on nucleic acid detection (including amplification strategies and on selected probe systems using fluorescent labeling). Specific sections cover chemical properties of microbeads, the coupling of targets onto solid surfaces, microbead probe systems (mainly oligonucleotide probes), microbead detection schemes (with subsections on suspension arrays, microfluidic devices, and immobilized microbeads), quantification of nucleic acids, {PCR} in solution and the detection of amplicons, and methods for solid-phase amplification. We discuss selected trends such as microbead-coupled amplification, heterogeneous and homogenous {DNA} hybridization assays, real-time assays, melting curve analysis, and digital microbead assays. We finally discuss the relevance and trends of the methods in terms of high-level multiplexed analysis and their potential in diagnosis and personalized medicine. Contains 211 references.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of different biomolecules is of prime importance for life science research and medical diagnostics. Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, {VideoScan}, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for {PCR} applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a {HEp}-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives {VideoScan} a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of quantitative {PCR} data usually does not take into account the fact that the increase in fluorescence depends on the monitoring chemistry, the input of ds-{DNA} or ss-{cDNA}, and the directionality of the targeting of probes or primers. The monitoring chemistries currently available can be categorized into six groups: (A) {DNA}-binding dyes; (B) hybridization probes; (C) hydrolysis probes; (D) {LUX} primers; (E) hairpin primers; and (F) the {QZyme} system. We have determined the kinetics of the increase in fluorescence for each of these groups with respect to the input of both ds-{DNA} and ss-{cDNA}. For the latter, we also evaluated {mRNA} and {cDNA} targeting probes or primers. This analysis revealed three situations. Hydrolysis probes and {LUX} primers, compared to {DNA}-binding dyes, do not require a correction of the observed quantification cycle. Hybridization probes and hairpin primers require a correction of −1 cycle (dubbed C-lag), while the {QZyme} system requires the C-lag correction and an efficiency-dependent C-shift correction. A {PCR} efficiency value can be derived from the relative increase in fluorescence in the exponential phase of the amplification curve for all monitoring chemistries. In case of hydrolysis probes, {LUX} primers and hairpin primers, however, this should be performed after cycle 12, and for the {QZyme} system after cycle 19, to keep the overestimation of the {PCR} efficiency below 0.5 \%. Figure The {qPCR} monitoring chemistries form six groups with distinct fluorescence kinetics. The displacement of the amplification curve depends on the chemistry, {DNA} input and probe-targeting. The observed shift in Cq values can be corrected and {PCR} efficiencies can be derived.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA transcripts such as mRNA or microRNA are frequently used as biomarkers to determine disease state or response to therapy. Reverse transcription (RT) in combination with quantitative PCR (qPCR) has become the method of choice to quantify small amounts of such RNA molecules. In parallel with the democratization of RT-qPCR and its increasing use in biomedical research or biomarker discovery, we witnessed a growth in the number of gene expression data analysis methods. Most of these methods are based on the principle that the position of the amplification curve with respect to the cycle-axis is a measure for the initial target quantity: the later the curve, the lower the target quantity. However, most methods differ in the mathematical algorithms used to determine this position, as well as in the way the efficiency of the PCR reaction (the fold increase of product per cycle) is determined and applied in the calculations. Moreover, there is dispute about whether the PCR efficiency is constant or continuously decreasing. Together this has lead to the development of different methods to analyze amplification curves. In published comparisons of these methods, available algorithms were typically applied in a restricted or outdated way, which does not do them justice. Therefore, we aimed at development of a framework for robust and unbiased assessment of curve analysis performance whereby various publicly available curve analysis methods were thoroughly compared using a previously published large clinical data set (Vermeulen et al., 2009) [11]. The original developers of these methods applied their algorithms and are co-author on this study. We assessed the curve analysis methods’ impact on transcriptional biomarker identification in terms of expression level, statistical significance, and patient-classification accuracy. The concentration series per gene, together with data sets from unpublished technical performance experiments, were analyzed in order to assess the algorithms’ precision, bias, and resolution. While large differences exist between methods when considering the technical performance experiments, most methods perform relatively well on the biomarker data. The data and the analysis results per method are made available to serve as benchmark for further development and evaluation of qPCR curve analysis methods (http://qPCRDataMethods.hfrc.nl).},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative bioanalytical measurements are commonly performed in a kinetic format and are known to not be robust to perturbation that affects the kinetics itself or the measurement of kinetics. We hypothesized that the same measurements performed in a ?digital? (single-molecule) format would show increased robustness to such perturbations. Here, we investigated the robustness of an amplification reaction (reverse-transcription loop-mediated amplification, RT-LAMP) in the context of fluctuations in temperature and time when this reaction is used for quantitative measurements of HIV-1 RNA molecules under limited-resource settings (LRS). The digital format that counts molecules using dRT-LAMP chemistry detected a 2-fold change in concentration of HIV-1 RNA despite a 6 °C temperature variation (p-value = 6.7 ? 10?7), whereas the traditional kinetic (real-time) format did not (p-value = 0.25). Digital analysis was also robust to a 20 min change in reaction time, to poor imaging conditions obtained with a consumer cell-phone camera, and to automated cloud-based processing of these images (R2 = 0.9997 vs true counts over a 100-fold dynamic range). Fluorescent output of multiplexed PCR amplification could also be imaged with the cell phone camera using flash as the excitation source. Many nonlinear amplification schemes based on organic, inorganic, and biochemical reactions have been developed, but their robustness is not well understood. This work implies that these chemistries may be significantly more robust in the digital, rather than kinetic, format. It also calls for theoretical studies to predict robustness of these chemistries and, more generally, to design robust reaction architectures. The SlipChip that we used here and other digital microfluidic technologies already exist to enable testing of these predictions. Such work may lead to identification or creation of robust amplification chemistries that enable rapid and precise quantitative molecular measurements under LRS. Furthermore, it may provide more general principles describing robustness of chemical and biological networks in digital formats.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Quantification cycle (Cq) and amplification efficiency (AE) are parameters mathematically extracted from raw data to characterize quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions and quantify the copy number in a sample. Little attention has been paid to the effects of preprocessing and the use of smoothing or filtering approaches to compensate for noisy data. Existing algorithms largely are taken for granted, and it is unclear which of the various methods is most informative. We investigated the effect of smoothing and filtering algorithms on amplification curve data.
 METHODS: We obtained published high-replicate qPCR data sets from standard block thermocyclers and other cycler platforms and statistically evaluated the impact of smoothing on Cq and AE.
 RESULTS: Our results indicate that selected smoothing algorithms affect estimates of Cq and AE considerably. The commonly used moving average filter performed worst in all qPCR scenarios. The Savitzky–Golay smoother, cubic splines, and Whittaker smoother resulted overall in the least bias in our setting and exhibited low sensitivity to differences in qPCR AE, whereas other smoothers, such as running mean, introduced an AE-dependent bias.
 CONCLUSIONS: The selection of a smoothing algorithm is an important step in developing data analysis pipelines for real-time PCR experiments. We offer guidelines for selection of an appropriate smoothing algorithm in diagnostic qPCR applications.

  Abstract                 = {Fitting four-parameter sigmoidal models is one of the methods established in the analysis of quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}) data. We had observed that these models are not optimal in the fitting outcome due to the inherent constraint of symmetry around the point of inflection. Thus, we found it necessary to employ a mathematical algorithm that circumvents this problem and which utilizes an additional parameter for accommodating asymmetrical structures in sigmoidal {qPCR} data. {PMID}: 18445269},

  Abstract                 = {We have examined the imprecision in the estimation of PCR efficiency by means of standard curves based on strategic experimental design with large number of technical replicates. In particular, how robust this estimation is in terms of a commonly varying factors: the instrument used, the number of technical replicates performed and the effect of the volume transferred throughout the dilution series. We used six different qPCR instruments, we performed 1–16 qPCR replicates per concentration and we tested 2–10 μl volume of analyte transferred, respectively. We find that the estimated PCR efficiency varies significantly across different instruments. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we find the uncertainty in the PCR efficiency estimation may be as large as 42.5\% (95\% CI) if standard curve with only one qPCR replicate is used in 16 different plates. Based on our investigation we propose recommendations for the precise estimation of PCR efficiency: (1) one robust standard curve with at least 3–4 qPCR replicates at each concentration shall be generated, (2) the efficiency is instrument dependent, but reproducibly stable on one platform, and (3) using a larger volume when constructing serial dilution series reduces sampling error and enables calibration across a wider dynamic range.},

  Abstract                 = {We have evaluated a microfluidic lab-on-chip quantitative reverse transcription ({RT}) quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) method by measuring the expression of key actors of liver metabolism in lactating cattle. Animals in the early and in the late lactation phases were chosen because of the extreme adaptations in gene expression expected to occur. During the lactation cycle, 28 out of 48 genes were significantly regulated, notably in the same direction as previously shown by other techniques. This demonstrates that this high-throughput platform represents an attractive alternative to microarrays due to its ease of application, rapidity and lower costs. A set of 13 genes was identified—in combination with a dynamic {PCA} algorithm—that allowed the clearest separation between the two physiologically different groups. This paves the way for classification and diagnosis of animals in different metabolic situations by a reliable microfluidic {RT}-{qPCR} assay. Figure To determine the pattern of genes, which visualizes the separation of animals in the two lactation stages best, dynamic {PCA} was employed. A pattern of 13 genes was identified. Black dots represent the samples obtained from animals in early lactation and white dots represent samples from animals in late lactation.},

  Abstract                 = {This review covers three aspects of {PCR}-based microfluidic chip assays: sample preparation, target amplification, and product detection. We also discuss the challenges related to the miniaturization and integration of each assay and make a comparison between conventional and microfluidic schemes. In order to accomplish these essential assays without human intervention between individual steps, the micro-components for fluid manipulation become critical. We therefore summarize and discuss components such as microvalves (for fluid regulation), pumps (for fluid driving) and mixers (for blending fluids). By combining the above assays and microcomponents, {DNA} testing of multi-step bio-reactions in microfluidic chips may be achieved with minimal external control. The combination of assay schemes with the use of micro-components also leads to rapid methods for {DNA} testing via multi-step bioreactions. Contains 259 references.

  Abstract                 = {The PMML package exports a variety of predictive and descriptive models from R to the Predictive Model Markup Language (Data Mining Group, 2008). PMML is an XML-based language and has become the de-facto standard to represent not only predictive and descriptive models, but also data pre- and post-processing. In so doing, it allows for the interchange of models among different tools and environments, mostly avoiding proprietary issues and incompatibilities. The PMML package itself (Williams et al., 2009) was conceived at first as part of Togaware{\rq}s data mining toolkit Rattle, the R Analytical Tool To Learn Easily (Williams, 2009). Although it can easily be accessed through Rattle{\rq}s GUI, it has been separated from Rattle so that it can also be accessed directly in R. In the next section, we describe PMML and its overall structure. This is followed by a description of the functionality supported by the PMML package and how this can be used in R. We then discuss the importance of working with a valid PMML file and finish by highlighting some of the debate surrounding the adoption of PMML by the data mining community at large.},
