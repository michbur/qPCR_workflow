  Abstract                 = {Background: Currently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}) experiments. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader{\rq}s ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments. Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time {PCR} Experiments ({MIQE}) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. {MIQE} is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating {qPCR} experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. {MIQE} details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement. Summary: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of {qPCR} results.},

The options for quantitative gene expression profiling and whole transcriptome sequencing by next generation sequencing are reviewed alongside the bioinformatic considerations for these approaches. Considering the diverse technologies now available for transcriptome analysis, methods for standardising measurements between platforms will be paramount if their diagnostic impact is to be maximised. Therefore, the use of {RNA} standards and other reference materials is also discussed.},

Incomplete, uninformative or misleading retraction announcements have led to a previous underestimation of the role of fraud in the ongoing retraction epidemic. The percentage of scientific articles retracted because of fraud has increased ∼10-fold since 1975.

  Abstract                 = {Real-time {PCR} analysis is a sensitive {DNA} 
quantification 
technique that has recently gained considerable attention in biotechnology, 
microbiology and molecular diagnostics. Although, the cycle-threshold (Ct) 
method is the present "gold standard", it is far from being a standard assay. 
Uniform reaction efficiency among samples is the most important assumption of 
this method. Nevertheless, some authors have reported that it may not be 
correct 
and a slight {PCR} efficiency decrease of about 4\% could result in an error of 
up to 400\% using the Ct method. This reaction efficiency decrease may be 
caused 
by inhibiting agents used during nucleic acid extraction or copurified from the 
biological sample.

  Abstract                 = {There is growing interest in digital {PCR} ({dPCR)} because technological progress makes it a practical and increasingly affordable technology. {dPCR} allows the precise quantification of nucleic acids, facilitating the measurement of small percentage differences and quantification of rare variants. {dPCR} may also be more reproducible and less susceptible to inhibition than quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR).} Consequently, {dPCR} has the potential to have a substantial impact on research as well as diagnostic applications. However, as with {qPCR}, the ability to perform robust meaningful experiments requires careful design and adequate controls. To assist independent evaluation of experimental data, comprehensive disclosure of all relevant experimental details is required. To facilitate this process we present the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital {PCR} Experiments guidelines. This report addresses known requirements for {dPCR} that have already been identified during this early stage of its development and commercial implementation. Adoption of these guidelines by the scientific community will help to standardize experimental protocols, maximize efficient utilization of resources, and enhance the impact of this promising new technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital {PCR} offers very high sensitivity compared to many other technologies for processing molecular detection assays. Herein, a process is outlined for determining the lower limit of detection ({LoD}) of two droplet-based digital {PCR} assays for point mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) gene. Hydrolysis probe mutation-detection assays for {EGFR} p.L858R and p.T790M mutations were characterized in detail. Furthermore, sixteen additional cancer-related mutation assays were explored by the same approach. For the {EGFR} L8585R assay, the assay sensitivity is extremely good, and thus, the {LoD} is limited by the amount of amplifiable {DNA} that is analyzed. With 95\% confidence limits, the {LoD} is one mutant in 180,000 wild-type molecules for the evaluation of 3.3 μg of genomic {DNA}, and detection of one mutant molecule in over 4 million wild-type molecules was achieved when 70 million copies of {DNA} were processed. The measured false-positive rate for the {EGFR} L8585R assay is one in 14 million, which indicates the theoretical {LoD} if an unlimited amount of {DNA} is evaluated. For the {EFGR} T790M assay, the {LoD} is one mutant in 13,000 for analysis of a 3.3 μg sample of genomic {DNA}, and the {dPCR} assay limit sensitivity approaches one mutant in 22,000 wild-type molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time {PCR} is being used increasingly as the method of choice for {mRNA} quantification, allowing rapid analysis of gene expression from low quantities of starting template. Despite a wide range of approaches, the same principles underlie all data analysis, with standard approaches broadly classified as either absolute or relative. In this study we use a variety of absolute and relative approaches of data analysis to investigate nocturnal c-fos expression in wild-type and retinally degenerate mice. In addition, we apply a simple algorithm to calculate the amplification efficiency of every sample from its amplification profile. We confirm that nocturnal c-fos expression in the rodent eye originates from the photoreceptor layer, with around a 5-fold reduction in nocturnal c-fos expression in mice lacking rods and cones. Furthermore, we illustrate that differences in the results obtained from absolute and relative approaches are underpinned by differences in the calculated {PCR} efficiency. By calculating the amplification efficiency from the samples under analysis, comparable results may be obtained without the need for standard curves. We have automated this method to provide a means of streamlining the real-time {PCR} process, enabling analysis of experimental samples based upon their own reaction kinetics rather than those of artificial standards.},

  Abstract                 = {Microbead-based technologies represent elegant and versatile approaches for highly parallelized quantitative multiparameter assays. They also form the basis of various techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic acids and proteins. Nucleic acid-based methods include hybridization assays, solid-phase {PCR}, sequencing, and trapping assays. Microbead assays have been improved in the past decades and are now important tools in routine and point-of-care diagnostics as well as in life science. Its advances include low costs, low workload, high speed and high-throughput automation. The potential of microbead-based assays therefore is apparent, and commercial applications can be found in the detection and discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphism, of pathogens, and in trapping assays. This review provides an overview on microbead-based platforms for biosensing with a main focus on nucleic acid detection (including amplification strategies and on selected probe systems using fluorescent labeling). Specific sections cover chemical properties of microbeads, the coupling of targets onto solid surfaces, microbead probe systems (mainly oligonucleotide probes), microbead detection schemes (with subsections on suspension arrays, microfluidic devices, and immobilized microbeads), quantification of nucleic acids, {PCR} in solution and the detection of amplicons, and methods for solid-phase amplification. We discuss selected trends such as microbead-coupled amplification, heterogeneous and homogenous {DNA} hybridization assays, real-time assays, melting curve analysis, and digital microbead assays. We finally discuss the relevance and trends of the methods in terms of high-level multiplexed analysis and their potential in diagnosis and personalized medicine. Contains 211 references.},

Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, {VideoScan}, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for {PCR} applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a {HEp}-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives {VideoScan} a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {The {chipPCR} package is a toolkit of functions to preprocess amplification curve data. Amplification data can be obtained from conventional {PCR} reactions or isothermal amplification reactions. The package contains functions to normalize and baseline amplification curves, a routine to detect the start of an amplification reaction, several smoothers for amplification data, a function to distinguish positive and negative amplification reactions and a function to determine the amplification efficiency. The smoothers are based on {LOWESS}, moving average, cubic splines, Savitzky-Golay and others. In addition the first approximate approximate derivative maximum ({FDM}) and second approximate derivative maximum ({SDM}) can be calculated by a 5-point-stencil as quantification points from real-time amplification curves. {chipPCR} contains data sets of experimental nucleic acid amplification systems including the {VideoScan} {HCU} and a capillary convective {PCR} ({ccPCR}) system. The amplification data were generated by helicase dependent amplification ({HDA}) or polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) under various temperature conditions. As detection system intercalating dyes ({EvaGreen}, {SYBR} Green) and hydrolysis probes ({TaqMan}) were used. The latest source code is available via: https://github.com/michbur/{chipPCR}},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of quantitative {PCR} data usually does not take into account the fact that the increase in fluorescence depends on the monitoring chemistry, the input of ds-{DNA} or ss-{cDNA}, and the directionality of the targeting of probes or primers. The monitoring chemistries currently available can be categorized into six groups: (A) {DNA}-binding dyes; (B) hybridization probes; (C) hydrolysis probes; (D) {LUX} primers; (E) hairpin primers; and (F) the {QZyme} system. We have determined the kinetics of the increase in fluorescence for each of these groups with respect to the input of both ds-{DNA} and ss-{cDNA}. For the latter, we also evaluated {mRNA} and {cDNA} targeting probes or primers. This analysis revealed three situations. Hydrolysis probes and {LUX} primers, compared to {DNA}-binding dyes, do not require a correction of the observed quantification cycle. Hybridization probes and hairpin primers require a correction of −1 cycle (dubbed C-lag), while the {QZyme} system requires the C-lag correction and an efficiency-dependent C-shift correction. A {PCR} efficiency value can be derived from the relative increase in fluorescence in the exponential phase of the amplification curve for all monitoring chemistries. In case of hydrolysis probes, {LUX} primers and hairpin primers, however, this should be performed after cycle 12, and for the {QZyme} system after cycle 19, to keep the overestimation of the {PCR} efficiency below 0.5 \%. Figure The {qPCR} monitoring chemistries form six groups with distinct fluorescence kinetics. The displacement of the amplification curve depends on the chemistry, {DNA} input and probe-targeting. The observed shift in Cq values can be corrected and {PCR} efficiencies can be derived.},

  Abstract                 = {{RNA} transcripts such as {mRNA} or {microRNA} are frequently used as biomarkers to determine disease state or response to therapy. Reverse transcription ({RT)} in combination with quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR)} has become the method of choice to quantify small amounts of such {RNA} molecules. In parallel with the democratization of {RT-qPCR} and its increasing use in biomedical research or biomarker discovery, we witnessed a growth in the number of gene expression data analysis methods. Most of these methods are based on the principle that the position of the amplification curve with respect to the cycle-axis is a measure for the initial target quantity: the later the curve, the lower the target quantity. However, most methods differ in the mathematical algorithms used to determine this position, as well as in the way the efficiency of the {PCR} reaction (the fold increase of product per cycle) is determined and applied in the calculations. Moreover, there is dispute about whether the {PCR} efficiency is constant or continuously decreasing. Together this has lead to the development of different methods to analyze amplification curves. In published comparisons of these methods, available algorithms were typically applied in a restricted or outdated way, which does not do them justice. Therefore, we aimed at development of a framework for robust and unbiased assessment of curve analysis performance whereby various publicly available curve analysis methods were thoroughly compared using a previously published large clinical data set (Vermeulen et al., 2009) [11]. The original developers of these methods applied their algorithms and are co-author on this study. We assessed the curve analysis methods' impact on transcriptional biomarker identification in terms of expression level, statistical significance, and patient-classification accuracy. The concentration series per gene, together with data sets from unpublished technical performance experiments, were analyzed in order to assess the algorithms' precision, bias, and resolution. While large differences exist between methods when considering the technical performance experiments, most methods perform relatively well on the biomarker data. The data and the analysis results per method are made available to serve as benchmark for further development and evaluation of {qPCR} curve analysis methods ({http://qPCRDataMethods.hfrc.nl).}},

Animals in the early and in the late lactation phases were chosen because of the extreme adaptations in gene expression expected to occur. During the lactation cycle, 28 out of 48 genes were significantly regulated, notably in the same direction as previously shown by other techniques. This demonstrates that this high-throughput platform represents an attractive alternative to microarrays due to its ease of application, rapidity and lower costs. A set of 13 genes was identified—in combination with a dynamic {PCA} algorithm—that allowed the clearest separation between the two physiologically different groups. This paves the way for classification and diagnosis of animals in different metabolic situations by a reliable microfluidic {RT}-{qPCR} assay. Figure To determine the pattern of genes, which visualizes the separation of animals in the two lactation stages best, dynamic {PCA} was employed. A pattern of 13 genes was identified. Black dots represent the samples obtained from animals in early lactation and white dots represent samples from animals in late lactation.},

PMML is an XML-based language and has become the de-facto standard to represent not only predictive and descriptive models, but also data pre- and post-processing. In so doing, it allows for the interchange of models among different tools and environments, mostly avoiding proprietary issues and incompatibilities. The PMML package itself (Williams et al., 2009) was conceived at first as part of Togaware{\rq}s data mining toolkit Rattle, the R Analytical Tool To Learn Easily (Williams, 2009). Although it can easily be accessed through Rattle{\rq}s GUI, it has been separated from Rattle so that it can also be accessed directly in R. In the next section, we describe PMML and its overall structure. This is followed by a description of the functionality supported by the PMML package and how this can be used in R. We then discuss the importance of working with a valid PMML file and finish by highlighting some of the debate surrounding the adoption of PMML by the data mining community at large.},
